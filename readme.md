## Vision

The **Decentralized Education Certificate Issuance** contract aims to revolutionize the way educational certificates are issued and verified. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract provides a secure, transparent, and immutable system for managing certificates. It ensures that once issued, certificates are permanent and tamper-proof, reducing fraud and administrative overhead for educational institutions.
